I have a strong interest in the financial sector, which I’ve experienced from my internships, where I’ve gained exposure to business opportunities related to acquisition, and investing. The biggest reason for working for Goldman Sachs is that it is very diverse it terms of opportunity and people.  There are many opportunity to work in different aspects of the business from building financial systems to protecting systems from vulnerabilities. I'll be able to network, and learn from leading professional who make changes around the world.

Throughout my university,  I’ve gained a lot of experience in programming by learning different programming languages, working with a team and meeting deadlines. These are all important, as learning languages/frameworks is something that will happen time and time again depending on the project. As a software engineer, you are working and learning constantly from different people. I have also worked as a customer assistant at Tesco for the past 3 years; I have fostered good communication skills and worked with teams to minimise shrink, and maximise customer satisfaction to improve store ratings. I’m driven by self-improvement, and learning different aspects of the business, and it is something that I would bring to Goldman Sachs.
