### Please outline how you meet the minimum criteria specified in the advert?
I'm currently studying BSc Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Manchester - on target 1st class honors.
I have a strong interest in software development. I'm currently working on a project, where I will be trying to program multiple autonomous drones to help hone in towards a signal. The application for this is to help search and rescue operations. During the project, I've had to look through lots of research papers and develop my model for testing/developing my code, which has helped me develop my problem-solving skills. 
I've developed good communication skills whilst working for Tesco. I'm very good at listening to people, and understanding their needs. I've had experience with solving difficult customer complaints/inquiries. During peak hours, working succinctly in a team is vital to providing excellent customer service. Overall working in customer service has helped me develop my teamwork, and communication skills.

### What is it about the TV industry and ITV as an employer that attracted you to this graduate position?
I love that ITV provides a broad range of services and entertainment. I love watching the news, and being informed about developing aspects of the British economy, and I enjoy watching Piers Morgan! ITV is very creative and therefore there are a lot of different challenges. With these challenges and opportunities, it will allow me to develop my programming skills, through its supportive learning environment and be able to apply them in the diverse workplace. I'll be able to work with experienced engineers and gain exposure to different technologies. I will be able to collaborate with different people and learn from them, and also by working on projects that can impact the business. I am excited about contributing to the development of the driving experience and helping shape the future of the TV industry. ITV is big on its impact on society, and I want to partake in that.



### Drawing on your experiences, interests or studies, what is it that makes you particularly suited to this Technology Graduate role?
I'm very competent with Python and Java since I've worked with them on many projects. I've used Python for some machine learning projects/coursework, and I have used Java to make a simple card game. In addition, some of my university modules required the use of C/C++ which I've self-taught, but it is not as competent as my Java/Python. I've made a few web applications, so I've gained some experience in using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. I've done a group project with my friends, where we collaborated in terms of ideas, as well as shared workload to complete a task. 

I've got a mathematical background especially in Statistics. I've done quite a lot of work around probability models,  estimating what the best model is, and completing an analysis on the model.

Overall, I've got a strong coding and mathematical foundation, which will be very useful in the role.


### Why do you think technology is so important to ITVâ€™s long term success, and what threats does it also bring?
There are more and more streaming services and digital platforms, which have intensified competition over the last decade. ITV has to be unique, predict what consumers want and present it to consumers. Since there are so many options available, it is also important that the consumers are listened to, so they feel like valued customers; treating their issues is a lot priority. So ensuring that the technology develops as people's tastes and preferences change is very important. 

In recent years, data breaches have also become more common due to some negligence of companies. This can hamper the company's reputation and drive consumers away. So, it is vital to maintain a good reputation and protect consumer's data.
### In the wider media industry, what do you think will be the next big technology innovation, how will it be used, and why?
Something really popular recently is Virtual Reality, which has exploded due to Meta. One thing that comes to my mind is meeting celebrates in a virtual world, and you can do question and answer sessions with them. In addition to this, we can have guest viewers, which will allow them to talk in live shows. This can make the show more interactive, and engage more viewers. It can also build a new network where people can meet people in a virtual world, and talk about certain shows/news.
