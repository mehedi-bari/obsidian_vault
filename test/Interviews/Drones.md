I'm currently working with multi-agent drones, and training them with reinforcement learning. My main goal is to deploy multiple drones in an unknown environment and its objective is to find a signal by working together.  At first, I've not done any reinforcement learning before, so I had to learn the fundamentals, and basic linguistics. Then, I had to get up to date with working with PyTorch, which has a lot of reinforcement learning algorithms so it would make it easy to implement a prototype, and try to simulate a Crazyflie drones in PyBullet. The whole task is massive, but I've been taking small step to learn and implement more complex algorithms, and my goal is to use Deep Q learning to get this done.
