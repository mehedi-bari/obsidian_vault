# Reimagine

>It is about becoming carbon net zero by 2039. It means we are committed to ambitious Science Based Targets.

Reducing our greenhouse emissions by 54 percent across our entire supply and operations chain by 2030 compared to levels in 2019.Â  Transforming our vehicles to electric. By the end of the decade every model will be available with full battery power. We will launch six pure-electric models across the Range Rover, Discovery and Defender brands by 2026, starting with the all-electric Range Rover in 2024.

>It is about our technology and digital services leadership.

Pioneering technologies such as our Over-The-Air capability to deliver a future of exceptional digital services, features and experiences for our clients.

>Our Open Innovation strategy means working with global start-ups and scale-ups, to bring new thinking and opportunities across seven key areas including sustainability, connectivity, and electrification.

It is about partnering with the innovators, developing strategic collaborations that allow us to lead not follow.


>Reimagine is about the renaissance of Jaguar as a pure-electric brand from 2025.

A copy of nothing, Jaguar will be respectful of the past, but not bound by it. A new distinct design language built on our new in-house platform will deliver a dramatic, truly aspirational brand.

## Wolfspeed
JLR & Wolfspeed have announced a strategic partnership to supply Silicon Carbide semiconductors for next generation electric vehicles, delivering increased powertrain efficiency and extended driving range. Under its Reimagine strategy, JLR is transforming to an electric-first business, to become carbon net zero across its supply chain by 2039.

## Nvidia
JLR is currently working with Nvidia, to jointly develop and deliver the next generation of automated driving systems plus Al-enabled services and experiences for its customers. 

## Sustainability 
De-carbonising our value chain, across our eco-design and materials,  manufacturing operations, supply chain, and electrification & battery strategy and up to end of life treatment. Reuse, refurbish including batteries for secondary applications.
Good for society, planet, our people & family, and obviously good for the business. 

To reimagine how our customers experience their vehicles, and how they connect, and interact on every journey.  
From 2025, all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will be integrated with the NVIDIA drive Hyperion **computing and sensing platforms.**  This includes the DRIVE orin system-on-a chip as the centralised computer to power safety, and network. 

It aims to provide the automation of driving regular routes, to advanced technology features and connected experiences,  it will be continuously refined by over the air update. 



# Presentation
For your presentation, we would like you to identify which area of the Reimagine Strategy personally
resonates with you, and how you hope to make an impact on the business and our customers in this area.
You can draw on your own interests or experiences to date, as well as any additional research you have
done into JLR, our Reimagine Strategy, and any challenges we face.

In your presentation you should focus on your academic studies to date, your interests and why you
believe you have the potential to succeed and make an impact in your chosen role at JLR.
- You can format your presentation in any way you like to address the topic you have been given.
If you decide to use a PowerPoint presentation, we would suggest anywhere between 4-6 slides
would be enough.
- Feel free to express your creativity in this exercise.


### Slide 1: Introduction

To start with, JLR is stepping into a new era with the "REIMAGINE" initiative. For me, whtat comes to my mind is taking a blank **canvass** and then brining it to life. This transformation requires something that is beyond just changing the materials and design, but an overhaul supplier relationships, and global manufacturing operations, which is a huge task in its self.  The commitment to deliver substantial changes related to being carbon net neutral by 2039 is not only impressive but exciting. Overall, it encapculates the spirit of making innovative changes and delivering on them.
 
### Slide 2: Open innovation
Open innovation is one of the main parts that caught my attention immediately. The strategic appraoch of investing into start-ups and scale up  emerging ideas/products.

The alliance with NVIDIA, which has been popular for the last decade proportional to the development of AI, crypo, and now autonomous vehicles. The development of cars with cutting-edge technology will change the shape of mobility, and how driver's interact with their cars. 

Furthermore the investment into Wolfspeed chips will improve the performance of EV vehicles by enhancing powertrain efficiency and extending driving range. 

JLR's dedication to embracing such advancements highlights to not just keeping pace with change but leading the charge into a new era.


### Slide 3: My interests: 
Autonomous Drones: For my project, I'm working with drones. Suppose you were lost in the woods, and you've sent out an SOS signal from a device. We're have a rough location, but we can't pin point your exact location due to complexity of the environment. The idea is to use drones to help find you, which is propagated by using multiple drones to hone in. The drones need to be trained in an environment to help it learn from its experience, and using Deep Q-learning to learn optimise the parameters.

NLP: This is has seen an surge of interest due to charGBT.  My focus was on training models to complete sentences and discover related ideas showcasing the versaility of NLP. In the automotive industrym it can refdine how user interacts with the vehicles.  It opens up the ablity to have seamless communication with car, and informing user's of navigation, and warnings. 

Face completion: This was one of my favourite, as it got me started on Machine Learning. The whole principle is to fill in missing parts of the face, and enable you to complete the picture. This has a lot of application in face recognition. This can be implemented into cars as an additional layer of security to unlock the car. In addition the driving setting can be catered towards you

Designing Games: My friend and I wanted to create a speed running game, where you are rewarded on how fast you are able to complete each game. 

I've got a strong interest in Machine Learning. I like generating idea, designed things and bringing them to life. Those are potential ideas that I've thought of that could be bring growth, and impact.
