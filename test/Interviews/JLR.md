I'm highly motivated to join the graduate team for JLR. I love the cars produced by the JLR group. They're cutting edge in technology both in terms of hardware and software. The software that the user experiences provides customers comfort,  by having autonomous capabilities, safety features, different terrain capabilities, and high performance; this gives the car an unparalleled experience.  

With this comes challenges and opportunities within the JLR group. It will allow me to develop my programming skills, through its supportive learning environment and be able to apply them in the workplace. I'll be able to work with experienced engineers and gain exposure to different technologies. I will be able to collaborate with different people and learn from them, and also by working on projects that can impact the business. I am excited about contributing to the development of the driving experience and help shape the future of the automotive industry.
  
Please describe your technical skills/abilities that are relevant to a role in Engineering (Maximum 200 words).

I'm very competent with Python and Java since I've worked with them on many projects. I've used Python for some machine learning projects/coursework, and I have used Java to make a simple card game. In addition, some of my university modules required the use of C/C++ which I've self-taught, but it is not as competent as my Java/Python. I've made a few web applications, so I've gained some experience in using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. I've done a group project with my friends, where we collaborated in terms of ideas, as well as shared workload to complete a task. 

I've got a mathematical background especially in Statistics. I've done quite a lot of work around probability models,  estimating what the best model is, and completing an analysis on the model.

Overall, I've got a strong coding and mathematical foundation, which will be very useful in the role.


Please describe your work experience/general experience that is relevant to a role in Engineering (Maximum 200 words)
 
I've done a summer internship at Bloomberg and JP Morgan. Both of these experiences were very similar. I was able to collaborate with a team in trying to solve coding problems/working on a project. We needed to work collaboratively to solve the problem. This required our understanding of algorithms and data structures to complete the solution. Finally, we had to present our findings to senior engineers/our mentor. It addition, I was given the opportunity to work with and learn from experienced engineers; it was amazing to see how they approached problems, and how they went around solving and contributing to the company. 


 Please describe the interests you have in Engineering. You can refer to your University modules and projects, any extra-curricular activities and your general passion for the role / industry (Maximum 300 words)

I have a strong passion for Machine Learning(ML).  I've worked on a couple of ML projects including face completion. The model is trained using the data and minimising the loss function, and it finds the best parameters. The parameters were found by using a method called gradient descent to quickly solve the equations, and find the best parameters. 

Now, I'm currently working with Agilicious drone. The main functionality that I'm working on is trying to stabilise the drones. The drones are capable of performing computational tasks and are equipped with the ability to process visual information. The task I would like to work on is capturing images, and control points to map an image of unreachable places. 

In addition, I've developed a web application called "The Challenges of ONI" with my friends. It is a game where you have to complete all the challenges as quickly as possible, which is like a speedrunning game. The iconic part of the game is "ONI", who is constantly distracting you, and teasing you about your poor performance, using the information from our database API.  We had great fun making it, and it was super challenging working out how to make our character come to life.
