### Passions
I throughly enjoying riding my bike.  The rusk of adrenaline  as I traverse scenic trails is a sensation like no other.  Beyond the thrill, cycling also provides a remarkably efficient means of navigating the vibrant city of Manchester- even if it rains quite often. It serves as my reliable mode of transportation for commuting to both work and university, offering a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative. I am a firm advocate for the importance of bike maintenance. Regularly investing in quality bike parts and taking the time to  mend both my own and others' bicycles has become a rewarding hobby. 

In addition to my passion for cycling, I immensely enjoy in a spirited game of badminton. Badminton, for me, is akin to a refreshing breeze on a scorching summer day. It's the one sport that seamlessly blends the thrill of competition with the delightful shared laughter. Whether it's a match with my university friends, colleagues at work, or a spirited family game, badminton has a unique way of bringing people together and infusing each moment with pure exhilaration.



### Courses
Currently, I'm with multi-agent drone systems, with a primary focus on training them using reinforcement learning techniques. My overarching objective involves deploying multiple drones in unfamiliar environments, where their collective mission is to collaboratively locate a signal source. This venture initially presented a steep learning curve for me, as I had no prior experience in reinforcement learning. To bridge this gap, I enrolled in a course aptly named "Reinforcement Learning Beginner to Mastery."

This course has been instrumental in equipping me with the foundational knowledge of essential concepts such as Markov Decision Processes, dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal difference learning. It also provides a corresponding GitHub repository, which enables me to apply these theoretical underpinnings to practical tasks, gaining hands-on experience in the process.In parallel, I've been dedicating time to familiarise myself with PyTorch, a versatile framework replete with a plethora of reinforcement learning algorithms. 

Admittedly, the scale of this undertaking is substantial, but I've adopted an incremental approach, taking small but deliberate steps. My overarching aim is to leverage the power of Deep Q Learning to navigate the complexities of this project and ultimately achieve the desired outcome.



### WHY accenture:



Whilst working for Tesco, I demonstrated a high degree of attentiveness and consideration for customers' needs. A notable incident exemplifying this occurred when I encountered a customer who appeared to be somewhat lost while navigating the store's aisles.

Approaching her with a friendly demeanour, I engaged in a conversation to better understand her needs and intentions. It became evident that she was from a different country and was seeking specific items for her mother, which, unfortunately, we did not sell. Despite this limitation, I remained committed to assisting her.

I proceeded to provide her with information on where she might be able to acquire the items she was seeking in the vicinity. Throughout our conversation, the customer began to open up about her life situation and the challenges she had been facing. I actively listened, offering empathy and support as she shared her experiences. By the end of our interaction, she expressed a sense of relief and comfort, having found a sympathetic ear.



This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of not only meeting customers' immediate needs but also providing a compassionate and understanding presence in their time of need.

I am good a problem solving. My friend and me were working on a project named "The Challenges of ONI," which is a speedrun-style game that requires players to complete challenges as swiftly as possible. Given our tight deadline, seamless teamwork became important. In our team, we each assumed specific roles and responsibilities, leveraging our individual strengths. However, regular group meetings were essential to keep everyone updated on their progress and to address any challenges we encountered. 

A pivotal instance where teamwork played an important role was during the implementation of a key feature. Due to our time constraints, we initially encountered difficulties in getting it right, and he was struggling to meet the deadline. My friend and I, collaborated closely to find a creative and effective solution.
