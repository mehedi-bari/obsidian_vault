During my time at Tesco, I consistently prioritized customer needs and exhibited a strong sense of attentiveness. An illustrative incident involved encountering a customer who seemed lost within the store. With a welcoming demeanor, I engaged her in conversation, learning that she was from another country and searching for specific items for her mother, which, regrettably, we didn't stock. Undeterred, I provided information about nearby sources for her desiqred items. As we conversed, she shared her personal challenges, and I actively listened, offering empathy and support. Our interaction left her feeling comforted and understood, underscoring the value of compassionate customer service in addressing diverse needs.

I demonstrated good teamwork whilst working on a project called "The Challenges of ONI," a speedrun-style game where rapid challenge completion was the goal.
Within our team, each of us played to our individual strengths, assuming specific roles and responsibilities. Regular group meetings served as a linchpin, ensuring everyone remained informed about progress and ready to tackle any challenges that arose. A pivotal moment for our team was during the implementation of a critical feature. Faced with time constraints and a close deadline, one team member was struggling. It was at this juncture that my friend and I closely collaborated, showcasing the power of teamwork by finding a creative and effective solution together.

  
I'm good at adapting to complex/new tasks, and learning from my mistakes. It became evident during a challenging assignment involving the functional programming language Haskell. Haskell introduced a completely new programming paradigm, making it seem like I was starting from scratch. Initially, I tackled the assignments head-on, hoping to learn as I progressed. However, in hindsight, this strategy proved less effective. I adopted a new approach; it became apparent that starting with smaller, simpler problems to understand the unique problem-solving patterns within this new paradigm. This approach provided a stronger foundation for grasping the novel problem-solving methodology. The experience taught me the importance of embracing unfamiliar territory and experimenting with simpler tasks before taking on larger, complex challenges.
