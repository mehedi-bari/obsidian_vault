I've a strong passion for Machine Learning(ML).  I've worked on a couple of ML projects including face completion. The model is trained using the data and minimising the loss function, and  it finds the best parameters. The parameters were found by using a method called gradient descent to quickly solve the equations, and find the best parameters. 

Now, I'm currently working with drone. The main functionality that I'm working on is trying to stabilise the drones. The drones are capable of performing computational task, and equipped with the ability to process visual information. The task I would like to work on is capture images, and control points to map an image of unreachable places. 

In addition, I've developed a web application called the "The Challenges of ONI" with my friends. It is a game where you have to complete all the challenges as quickly as possible, which is like a speedrun game. The iconic part of the game is "ONI", who is constantly distracting you, and teasing you about your poor performance, using the information from our database API.  We had great fun making it, and it was super challenging working our how to make our character come to life.
