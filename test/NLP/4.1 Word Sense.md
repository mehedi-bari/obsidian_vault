Word sense refers to one of the **meaning** of a linguistic.
**Word Sense Disambiguation**(WSD) is an NLP task of selecting which **sense** of a word is used in a given piece of text (e.g., a sentence) from a set of multiple known possibilities (sense candidates).

There are two types of WSD approaches:
$\square$  Knowledge-based: uses **external lexical resources** e.g. dictionary, thesaurus, WordNets.
$\square$  Supervised machine learning approaches: use **labelled training corpus**.


## Knowledge-based WSD:
You need a **Machine Readable Thesaurus**(MRS), like a dictionary, which has a number words along with their senses. 

The typical approach is using Lexical + Corpus :
**Simplified Lesk** examines the overlap between the word and the current context and the sense definition of the word. 
	$\square$  We can find all the different senses definitions of a word
	$\square$  Calculate the overlap between each sense of a word and its current context.
	$\square$  Choose the one with the most overlap.

We can further improve this by providing **more label data**, using a corpus.
We can also introduce a better weight system:

## Building a WSD classifier:
You would need a word-sense annotated corpus. Then characterise each word pattern along with its context with a set of features(feature extraction.) Train them, and test it with new examples.
