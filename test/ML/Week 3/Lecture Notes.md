How would you show that the videos that are shown for kids?
- You would want more precision than recall.
- This is because you don't want to reduce the False Positives, because you don't want to show anything inappropriate.
- Therefore, you want to increase precision, and reudce recell.

What do you want when you want to flag shop lifters?
-  You want high recall, and low precision.
- You want to flag properly, so you want to minimise the amount of False Negatives.
- If the fasle Positives were high, it is fine because we can use a human to remove that error.

- Precision and recall metrics are good for imbalanced class problems, and accuracy metric is not a good idea for imbalanced class problems.
