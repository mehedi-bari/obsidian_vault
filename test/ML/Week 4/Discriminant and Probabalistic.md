 Assume that we have already found theta, and we have the function for all of these.

## Discriminant Function By Thresholding:
- We focus on binary classification.
- Step 1: construct a real valued f(x)
- Step 2: convert the output to a class prediction by thresholding.

- The real number t can be treated as a hyper-pararameter.
- A common setting t=0/0.5

The contour line can partition the data, which will corresponding postive and negative parts.

## Â Classification by Probabilistc Inference
- Model the posterior class probability p(class k| x)
- Find the most likely class: y^ = argmax$_p$(class k| x)

#### How do you model the posterior class probability p(class k | x)?

#### What about regression?

- You can model the posterior distribution by using Approach II or III, and then you can find the conditional mean (which is its predicted output.)


### Examples:

- For an input they give you a probability output

- This returns a probability function, with some level of uncertainty/entropy, which can be used to calculate a probablility.
