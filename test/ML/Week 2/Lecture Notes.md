Euclidean distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is 1.4
The city block distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is 2
Minksowski distance between (0,0) and (1,1) with t=4 is 2^(1/4)=1.2

It is better to use a different set of samples to evalualte the classifier. It is a better to use a different sample, because it may lead ot bit overfit.
