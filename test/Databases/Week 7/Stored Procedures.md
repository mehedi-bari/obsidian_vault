		Stored Procedures:
		- A stored procedures is a segment of declarative SQL stored inside the MySQL server.
		- Once you've created and saved the stored the procedure you can invoke it by using CALL
		- Stored in the database, and then stored in the cache when first called.
		- Remains in cache for the rest of the session.
		- You can allow passing of parameters.
		- It allows flow control.
		- Allows others procedures to be called in.


		Advantages:
		- Minimises bandwidth: they don't need to send multiple sql statments, but rather can call a procedure.
		- Consistency: you don't need different kinds of statements to do the same thing.
		- Security: they can grant appropriate privileges to certain users.

		Disadvanges:
		- Requires additional resources.
		- It's difficult to debug stored procedures.
		- Requires a specialised skill set.

- They're stored in the infromation_schema, and in a table called routines.
- The routines need to be a procedure, and the routine_schema, is the name of the procedure.
