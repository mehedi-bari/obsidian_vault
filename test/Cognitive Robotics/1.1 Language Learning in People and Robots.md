**Cross situational learning:** Comparing two images/events to refine the meaning behind a word. 
We usually have biases - this is usually forms first guess. From psychology, we know it is the shape of things play an important role. 

**Grounding:** It is the mapping of sensory information- like sound, touch, sight - into physical experience, or something meaningful. 

Robots can be easily be pre-programmed to memorise a dictionary, but they cannot fully understand the language they use.
$\square$  Children use their body for **situated interaction**.
$\square$  The brain integrates language and sensorimotor knowledge. 
$\square$ Children develop **Theory of Mind** (ToM) - there are other agents have knowledge and desires- for social interaction.

Motor posture is very important when learning things. Motor posture in the task above helps make the association between the name of the object, even when the object is not visible. Since the spatial cue is consistent, they were able to recognise the object - through spatial memory.

**Fast-mapping:** this is where you tell the object its name, and show it to you.
**Postural-attention**: Shows the object, and then hides (when showing the object it is moved around, and shaken for shape bias), Then it is hidden, and hand movement to say where it was and what it was called.
**Mutual Exclusivity:**  If it it knows one of the objects, and by odd one out it learns the other one.
**Language Generalisation:** it uses shapes, and colours to give answers to unknown/unseen objects.
**Selective Attention**: This is where children usually has the most attention to the object that is the closest, or the largest in view. Adults will put somethings in front to get their attention, whilst saying its name. In terms of robotics, this will help segmentation and reduce noise.

# What is Cognitive Robotics?
Cognitive robotics is the field that combines insights and methods from AI, as well as cognitive and biological sciences, to robotics.
- It is about connecting psychologists, animal studies, neuroscience = natural sciences.
- AI
- Robotics

**Cognitive Robotics**: It is the `design/implementation` of the sensorimotor and cognitive capabilities in intelligent robots, taking direct inspiration form cognitive and biological sciences.
**Artificial Cognitive Systems:** It is `modelling` of robotics `agents` taking inspiration from natural sciences and cognitive systems. This is more philosophical. 
**Intelligent Robotics[Robotics & AI]**: Engineering approaches to the design of intelligent capabilities in robots using AI methods invariant of whether these methods are used in biology.  

## Notes from Posture affects how robots & infants maps words to objects:
The papers suggests that the motor aspect can contribute on both planning actions and mapping names to objects.  

DNF[Dynamic Neural Field] binds features by using shared spatial position. Then uses a second field that binds words and objects which has no spatial component. DNF learns through spatial correspondence, but the learned mapping between words and objects remains independent of spatial information. However, there are still **spatial biases**, this is because when you project the object-space map it contains some memories of the location. 

The alternative approach is building a physical device that can map words to objects and then show through physical behaviours that it has remembered the mapping. The robotic model learns through space- which is the same as DNF - but in the robotic model the spatial representations are tied to the momentary posture of the learner.  Then it generalised these learned mapping to new spatial locations, thus there is indirect mapping between words and objects.
  
The theoretical problem is how mental representations of objects and names, which have no spatial or bodily components, interact with the body's physical processes of perception and action. This issue arises because the body's position and movement capabilities, with various degrees of freedom, complicate the mapping of names to objects, highlighting the challenge of integrating cognitive processes with physical body dynamics in space.

To solve this problem, we need to incorporate an architecture that incorperates body's posture for action planning and linking internal activations from heard and seen object.  By using interconnected fields for words, visual objects and posture, the model facilitates learning and memory through continuous adaptation, with body posture serving as a crucial intermediary.

There are different approaches to cognitive robotics:
- **Developmental robotics**: learning about human/ animal babies. 
- **Evolutionary robotics**: this is where you have a population of robotics, and how they change over time.
- **Swarm robotics**: You have one population. It simulates the interaction between agents, and the intelligence of the swarm comes from the local interactions. Like termites, that have different agents with different roles.
- **Soft robotics**
- **Neurorobotics**: This is the development of robots that are inspired by the structure and functions of the human nervous system e.g. neuron, transformers.

Biological Inspiration: Either it is computations or biological. Computational we have the different parts are we are not bothered on how they're connected. For biological approaches, we would want to get the proportions right etc. 

Abstraction level: On a low level abstraction is to models the cells, the neurones. On a high level, we may consider the arm as functional element; like pixels. 

iCub is between computational and biological as it doesn't model the cells, and it has a lot of mechanical parts.

It has high level of abstractions, as it doesn't model as single sounds, but just a single word.
