There are 3 types of classification:
- Binary Classification: This is where there are 2 classes, and it belongs to one.
- Multinomial Classification: There are many classes, but it can belong to one.
- Multi-class Multi-label Classification: There are many classes, and it can belong to many.

These are some typical text classification tasks:
- **Paraphrasing**: Given two texts, we want to say whether it is a paraphrase or not(are they the same or not.)
- **Semantic Similarity**: Given two texts, we can create a stage of categories which indicate how similar they are. 
- **Textual Entailment:** This is where the first sentence can `contradict`, `entail`, or `neural` the following sentence.
- **Relation classification**: Given a fixed number of classes, you can set this up as text classification.

### Automated Fact Verification
This is where given a claim we want to verify whether the statement is true. The typical architecture is that you `query` a database, and collect and rank all the relevant information. Then use a **textual entailment classifier** to classify whether they support or reject the claim.

The basic way is using accuracy but you can also measure class accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.

However, if you have large class imbalances, f1-score and accuracy hide class imbalance. Therefore a  better metric is using **Mattew's Correlation Coefficient(MCC)** for single and multi-class. It produces a number between -1 and 1. However, we lose the idea of how good the model is. Hence, we use this as an indicator.
